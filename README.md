## Installation

In order to install this website the files will need to be cloned from the repository.
Once you have the files you can either deploy it via github by pushing it to your own
repository, or have it hosted on a domain.

## Usage

This website can be used in its current state as a random password generator. Pressing
the red button will firstly request a password length between 8-128, then it will
ask whether you want to include capital letters, symbols and numbers. After this
the functions inside the script.js will generate a new password using a random number
generator for each character in order to create an ASCII value.
It looks like this initially:
